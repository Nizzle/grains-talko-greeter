Talko counter with Mario piezo greeter firmware for Ginkosynthese Grains Eurorack Module.

This firmware is basically Talko counter firmware as found on:

But with a little gimmick.
When a piezo buzzer is added to the Arduino Nano, the module will greet you with a little tune when powered up.
Code for the tune is a heavily stripped down version of the code found on:

Without the buzzer the module will function just fine.
